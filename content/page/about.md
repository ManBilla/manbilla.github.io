## About
I am a data enthusiast, interested in Descriptive and Predictive Analytics, Process & Supply Chain Optimization, Machine learning and Data Visualization. With a bachelors in Civil Engineering and a strong Math background, I chose to pursue my Masters in Information Systems at the University of Cincinnati to develop my Technical and Business skills. I started exploring data science field here and acquired many skills via the data Analytics certificate program. I also gained a lot of knowledge via MOOC's and did some projects independently. 

Currently, I am working as a Supply Chain & Logistics execution consultant, optimizing transportation for several clients using SAP. Prior to this, I worked for 3+ years in a client facing Business Analyst role at IBM. My expertise was in Telecommunications and Retail sector -  Supply Chain Logistics & Execution. I optimized the transportation and shipping for Ericsson using SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM) which saved them millions of dollars in shipment costs. I was the spoc for Ad-Hoc Analysis and I created master data databases, some dashboards and Analytics which increased the supply chain visibility. I also got trained in Watson, Bluemix platforms while at IBM. I did proof of concepts for different tools like Automatic Regression Tester tool, Watson Text Analytics, etc at my work.
