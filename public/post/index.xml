      <description>Last year, I got into the Bertelsmann data science scholarship where, along with Python, Statistics, I also got to brush up my SQL skills. Time and again, I see myself searching for SQL cheatsheets whenever I forget something. So I decided to write all the tricks and tips into a blog for easy reference.

      <description>FInally, after much deliberation, I finished building my new website. I Initially had a basic google sites website showcasing my projects, experience, etc. Then after experimenting with Jekyll, Ghost, Hugo, etc., I finally settled upon Hugo ðŸ˜„. Then I discovered blogdown and moved my website into that. Yihui has written a pretty comprehensive book on blogdown which is available for free online and you should read that book if you want in-depth understanding of blogdown and hugo.</description>
